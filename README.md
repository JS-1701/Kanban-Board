# Kanban Board with Secure Login  
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

This application allows team members to securely log in and manage a Kanban board, which includes columns for ToDo, In Progress, and Done. The Kanban board allows users to interact with their tasks, adding, editing, and deleting tickets as needed. This system uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication and session management.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/kanban-board.git
   cd kanban-board
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file for both client and server with your specific configuration (e.g., `JWT_SECRET`, `DATABASE_URL`).

4. To seed the database (if applicable), run:
   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```

5. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

6. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Now, you can access the application by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

This application requires user authentication to access the Kanban board. To log in, use the credentials found in the `user-seeds.ts` file and run `npm run seed` again to add users to the system.

Once authenticated, users can view and manage their tasks on the Kanban board. For adding a new user or modifying existing users, you can directly edit the `user-seeds.ts` file and re-run the seed command.

## Features

- **Secure Login**: Users authenticate using a secure login page with JWT authentication.
- **Manage Tasks**: Users can add, edit, or delete tasks on the Kanban board.
- **Session Management**: Sessions expire after a period of inactivity, requiring reauthentication.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token storage and verification for authenticated users.
- **Redirection**: Unauthorized users are redirected to the login page if they attempt to access the board.
